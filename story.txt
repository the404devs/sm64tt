<html> Mario's House... <br><br> Mario! There's a letter from the princess!<br><br>She wants to see you at the castle, she made a cake!</html>,,img/story/mariohouse.jpg,,img/sprites/LFace.png,,Luigi,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,2,,0,,0,,0

<html>Mario arrived at Peach's Castle via warp pipe. <br><br>"Mama mia! What-a happened here?<br>Everything about the castle seems... off."<br><br>Will you enter?</html>,,img/story/castle.png,,img/sprites/MScare.gif,,Mario,,true,,yes,,no,,n/a,,n/a,,4,,5,,0,,0
<html>Mario went into the castle. The door locks behind you.<br>A high-pitched voice screamed, "HEY MARIO!!!!"<br>This sends a shiver down your spine.<br>Toad isn't standing in his usual <u>corner</u>, something is up.

<html>Mario went home to chill with Luigi. <br>Meanwhile, Toad consumed the kingdom<br>you died<br>the end</html>,,img/story/180px-BooMP8Official.png,,img/sprites/MDead.png,,Mario,,true,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,0,,0,,0,,0
<html>Passing through a door, you are in a large room with a painting of Bob-ombs hanging on the wall.<br><br>Not much in this room, but you feel like the walls are staring into your soul.</html>,,img/story/bobroom.jpg,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,8,,0,,0,,0
<html>You move towards the corner where Toad usually stood, and you notice a piece of paper laying on the ground. Upon further inspection, you realize it is a page out of Toad's diary.<br><br>You put it in your pocket for later, and go through the open door.</html>,,img/story/toadcorner.jpg,,img/sprites/MThink.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,6,,0,,0,,0,,1
<html>Wow! You're smack in the middle of a battlefield! There are Bob-ombs everywhere.<br><br>You see a wooden <u>ramp</u> ahead in the distance, and to the left there is a <u>valley</u>.<br><br>Where will you go?</html>,,img/story/bob.jpg,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,ramp,,valley,,n/a,,n/a,,9,,10,,0,,0
<html>You make your way down the path and up the ramp.<br>There is an open <u>field</u> to the right.<br>The path continues on past a large Chain Chomp guarding a <u>gate</u>.<br><br>Where will you go?</html>,,img/story/topramp.jpg,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,gate,,field,,n/a,,n/a,,12,,13,,0,,0
<html>You follow along the valley, past some Bob-ombs that are just hanging out, under a bridge, until you find a small gate.<br>It looks like there is a computer in there!<br><br>Will you break open the <u>gate</u>, or <u>return</u> to the starting area?</html>,,img/story/valley.jpg,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,gate,,return,,n/a,,n/a,,11,,8,,0,,0
<html>Busting open the gate with your fists (ow), you see the computer is running a very special game, called "Computer Science Simulator: 2017." Whatever. You sit down to play the game. <br>This is an easter egg. At this point, ICS sim was supposed to open, but we forgot it.</html>,,img/story/cave.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,11,,0,,0,,0
<html>As you approach the Chomp, you see that it isn't interested in stripping the flesh from your bones, and instead is staring off into the distance.<br>You look, and you see Toad starting to infect this world. That can't be good, so you'd better hurry up!</html>,,img/story/chomp1.jpg,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,14,,0,,0,,0
<html>There is a canon in this field, but it's broken. <br>Nothing helpful here, might as well go back.<br<br>Wait! There's a page out of a diary on the ground! You pick it up.</html>,,img/story/field.jpg,,img/sprites/MThink.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,9,,0,,0,,0,,2
<html>The bridge collapses as you cross. Looks like there's no going back.<br>You look back, and watch as Toad destroys the Chomp.<br> To your <u>left</u>, there is a small area with a few Goombas, and to the <u>right</u> you can head towards the mountain.<br>Where will you go?</html>,,img/story/bridge.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,left,,right,,n/a,,n/a,,15,,16,,0,,0
<html>What a cute little family of Goombas!<br><br>They are consumed by Toad, and so will you if you don't head up that mountain right away!</html>,,img/story/goombas.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,16,,0,,0,,0
<html>Standing at the base of the mountain, you see two paths leading up the mountain.<br><br>To the <u>left</u>, there is a steep slope.<br>To the <u>right</u>, there are large boulders rolling around, it looks pretty dangerous.<br>Where will you go?</html>,,img/story/BMount.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,left,,right,,n/a,,n/a,,17,,18,,0,,0
<html>You try to walk up the slope, but fail. If only you could kick your way up, or something.<br><br>You decide to go the other way, towards the boulders.</html>,,img/story/slide.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,18,,0,,0,,0
<html>The rolling of the boulders is quite unpredictable, but you manage to squeeze by.<br><br>The path up the mountain is clear.</html>,,img/story/squish.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,19,,0,,0,,0
<html>Halfway up the mountain path, you find a canon you can use to shoot yourself to the top.<br><br>That would be so much quicker, wouldn't it?<br><br>Will you use the canon?</html>,,img/story/Cannon.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,yes,,no,,n/a,,n/a,,20,,21,,0,,0
<html>After launching yourself from the canon, you realize your angle was a bit too low to reach the summit.<br>You bonk headfirst into the side of the mountain and fall into the Toad void.<br><br>Game over.</html>,,img/story/void.gif,,img/sprites/MDead.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,20,,0,,0,,0
<html>A most wise choice, those canons were never good anyways, unless you had wings on your hat.<br><br>You continue your climb up the mountain, unsure of what escape there can be from the Toad.</html>,,img/story/Walking.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,22,,0,,0,,0
<html>Arriving at the mountaintop, you see that King Bob-omb is still here, and he looks pretty worried about this whole Toad thing.<br><br>Toad has begun to consume the base of the mountain, so it looks like you're trapped up here.</html>,,img/story/Talk.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,23,,0,,0,,0
<html>The King has a Power Star, though. You know this from past experience.<br><br>Will you <u>ask</u> him for it, or will you <u>steal</u> it?</html>,,img/story/Talk.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,ask,,steal,,n/a,,n/a,,24,,26,,0,,0
<html>Explaining the situation to the king, he seems to understand.<br><br>Your old enemy says, "Mario, take my Star.

<html>You were never good at sneaking up on people, and the King catches you with your hand in his pocket.<br><br>He doesn't like thieves, and he tosses you off the mountain.<br><br>You fall into the endless Toad void.

<html>The star seems to have taken you to another world, it's like a floating fortress in the sky.<br><br>On your <u>left</u>, there is a tree you can climb, and on your <u>right</u> is a path leading up into the fortress, but it looks like the walls are moving up there.<br>Where will you go?,,img/story/WFSpawn.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,left,,right,,n/a,,n/a,,28,,30,,0,,0
<html>Climbing to the top of the tree, you realize you can jump to the area above you, a large pool of water.<br><br>You can go into the <u>pool</u>, or you can head up the <u>ramp</u> to the side.</html>,,img/story/Tree.png,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,pool,,ramp,,n/a,,n/a,,29,,32,,0,,0
<html>This pool isn't that deep, but you see something floating at the far end. <br><br>It's a soaked diary page. Gross.<br><br>You go back and head up the ramp.</html>,,img/story/Water.PNG,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,false,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,n/a,,32,,0,,0,,0,,3
<html>Yikes!<br>The walls are alive!<br>They're Toad!<br><br>Are you sure you want to go this way?</html>,,img/story/Wall.png,,img/sprites/MScare.gif,,Mario,,true,,yes,,no,,n/a,,n/a,,31,,28,,0,,0

<html>The first bridge collapses, but you are able to cross it in time.<br><br>The second bridge is literally a plank of wood, but it holds your weight.<br><br>The third bridge spins in a circle.

<html>You now have a clear path to the top of the fortress, but there a few <u>Whomps</u> in the way.<br><br>There is a tall <u>flagpole</u> off to the side as well.</html>,,img/story/PoleAndWhomp.PNG,,img/sprites/MFace.png,,Mario,,true,,whomps,,flagpole,,n/a,,n/a,,40,,37,,0,,0
