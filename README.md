# Super Mario 64: Toad's Terror

## June 15, 2018

Our final project from Grade 12. A text-based (horror?) adventure set in the world of Mario 64. Toad is taking over the universe, and you've gotta stop him.
This was a lot of fun to make, and it was absolute chaos. Definitely the highlight of Grade 12. Plenty of Mario 64 memes found within.

The best part of this project is the website that went along with it, preserved at http://the404.nl/software/sm64tt/
**06/09/20:** Since the site is now hosted on GitHub pages, PHP-based stuff no longer works, including the sm64tt site. While it is still *technically* preserved on 404, it won't actually work unless I completely rewrite it, which defeats the whole purpose of preservation.

Made in collaboration with Kevin, our final project together.


Something to note: due to space requirements, I had to modify some of the builds to reduce their size.
These are:
- sm64tt_v1_2_NO_IMG.zip
- sm64tt_v1_NO_IMG.zip
- sm64tt_beta_NO_IMG.zip
With these builds, you'll need to copy the `img` directory from this repo and add it to the contents of the zip, otherwise you'll have a very sad gameplay experience.

The original executable is preserved in its original state, alongside the early prototype build.
- sm64tt_v1.exe
- sm64tt_proto.exe


v1.2 (09/01/18): Added a "large screen" mode.
