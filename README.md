# Super Mario 64: Toad's Terror

## June 15, 2018

Our final project from Grade 12. A text-based (horror?) adventure set in the world of Mario 64. Toad is taking over the universe, and you've gotta stop him.
This was a lot of fun to make, and it was absolute chaos. Definitely the highlight of Grade 12. Plenty of Mario 64 memes found within.

The best part of this project is the website that went along with it, preserved at https://sm64tt.the404.nl

**06/09/20:** Since the site is now hosted on GitHub pages, PHP-based stuff no longer works, including the sm64tt site. While it is still *technically* preserved on 404, it won't actually work unless I completely rewrite it, which defeats the whole purpose of preservation.

**06/09/20, a few hours later:** It seems Mr. Krnic, our old CS teacher, still uses this project as an example. https://sebnic.info/_classTrees/ics4u/SUMMATIVE/ICS4UOwenGoodwin_Summative/index.php

**06/20/20:** I've created a snapshot of the main page, with the php content removed. This breaks stuff like the login and leaderboards, but the main body of the site will be preserved at https://sm64tt.the404.nl, since I can't guarantee Krnic will keep it on his site forever. I've removed the sm64tt site from the404 as I've preserved it the best I can here.


Made in collaboration with Kevin, our final project together.

v1.2 (09/01/18): Added a "large screen" mode.
