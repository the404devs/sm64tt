# Super Mario 64: Toad's Terror

## June 15, 2018

Our final project from Grade 12. A text-based (horror?) adventure set in the world of Mario 64. Toad is taking over the universe, and you've gotta stop him.
This was a lot of fun to make, and it was absolute chaos. Definitely the highlight of Grade 12. Plenty of Mario 64 memes found within.

The best part of this project is the website that went along with it, preserved at http://the404.nl/software/sm64tt/

Made in collaboration with Kevin, our final project together.
